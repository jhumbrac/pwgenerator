# password generator

Link to rendered page: https://jhumbrac.github.io/pwgenerator/

In this assignment I built a password generator that conforms to the user's custom settings. The user can select a password between 8 and 128 characters in length and can choose from several options such as the ability to add capital letters, numbers, and special characters. The password is then displayed on the page where it can be copy/pasted using a clipboard icon.

I chose to use the range slider in this assignment instead of a text input, and the value of the range is dynanmically displayed as the slider is adjusted.
